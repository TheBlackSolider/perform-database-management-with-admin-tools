        "\n",
        "In this project, we emulated the process of generating a MySQL database and users/permissions management with the help of the admin tools. We created a database called `ine_project` and set up user accounts for Alice, Bob, and Clara, each with specific permissions on three tables: Using variables `data1`, `data2`, and `data3 `.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Takeaways:\n",
        "- **Alice**: Is able to read details from all accessible tables.\n",
        "- **Bob**: Only has read with `data1`, write with `data2` and update permission on `data3`.\n",
        "- **Clara**: Unable to read top n columns from all the tables and is able to delete rows only from all the tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Future Enhancements:\n",
        "1. **Apply this on a live MySQL server**: Whenever access to a live MySQL server is made possible, what’s left of these simulations can readily be transformed into real SQL commands.\n",
        "2. **Explore more complex role-based permissions**: Finally, eliminate the user roles they are to introduce by providing specific permissions and create new roles using MySQL’s role management.\n",
        "3. **Audit and logging**: They ensure that the changes are captured according to the users’ activities through the process of user action logging.\n"
